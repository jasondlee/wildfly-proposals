= WildFly Feature Development Process

WildFly features can have one of four different maturity levels, “Experimental”, “Preview”, “Community” and an unnamed default level. Promotion from one level to another, or initial feature incorporation at a given level, requires meeting various standards in the basic areas of requirements analysis, implementation, testing and documentation. The following table outlines the various standards for each of the maturity levels.
